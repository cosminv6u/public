## Elastic Stack

These are some Logstash configurations that I played with for different use-cases.
Elastic Stack can be used to ingest huge quantities of semi-structured data and present it in tabular or graphical way.

## Motivation

Elastic Stack can be used to quickly browse big log files, present statistics, etc.
There's no code required, just configuration and the configurations are rather simple and self explanatory, I added few comments to clear some not evident things.
I encourage you to visit their website for more information and also experiment with it.
